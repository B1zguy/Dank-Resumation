Dank Resumation builds upon my work in Resume Automation[link git] by keeping the Python scraping part yet building the document processing side for Word instead of InDesign. This is due to friends being interested in using the program yet using Word for their resumes. Please note, this project unfinished.

The jobs.csv has been replaced w/ an Excel spreadsheet for ease of use.

In addition, this program is GUI based so the Word template and spreadsheet of URLs can be drag-dropped.

The current stage of the program is at implementing the template-rendering system.
